                    <p>Hello! My name is Thomas Larson, and I am a sound designer and composer, specializing in asset creation and audio 
                        implementation, most recently with MAGIC Spell Studios with the team on That Damn Goat.</p>
                    <p>As a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Game Design and Development, I have decided to work on building on the 
                        skills I developed while at college in sound design and composing. While having done sound design work for several class 
                        projects and professionally with MAGIC, I want to take the time to really learn the craft and build my skills and 
                        portfolio.</p>
                    <p>Alongside doing sound design, I have been a programmer, creating an audio system in Unity using Wwise and 
                        creating tools to improve the audio workflow with Reaper and Wwise.</p>
