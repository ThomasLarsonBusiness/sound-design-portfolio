                        multiplayer party game developed by a team of students at RIT, lead by a team of RIT faculty for PC and Switch. In this game, players compete 
                        in a variety of gamemodes across a variety of maps, all while a goat does everything in its power to create chaos amongst the players. 
                        For this project I was a sound designer and composer, responsible for creating sound effects and music for the project, as well as
                        implementing audio assets through Wwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/UEyrjRRjBVA">Watch the Trailer</a></p>

                        Tiny Little Files is a game set in the world of the Dresden Files, done by a team of 5 members. Tiny Little Files is a bullet hell game, 
                        where the player must fight their way through waves of enemies using two different weapons: a revolver and a blasting rod. For this project, 
                        I was the sound designer and composer, responsible for creating all of the sound effects and music for the project. Additionally, I 
                        was responsible for recording and implementing voice lines into the project. <a href=https://rocketcatt.itch.io/tiny-little-files>Game Here</a>
